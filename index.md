## Overview

The WildSpoof Challenge aims to advance the use of in-the-wild data in two speech processing tasks that generates and detects spoofed speech, **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** and **Spoofing-aware Automatic Speaker Verification (SASV)**, by promoting research that explores their close and increasingly interactive relationship. Specifically, we set the following objectives:

- Advance the use of in-the-wild data in two closely related but underexplored tasks: TTS and SASV, moving beyond conventional clean and controlled datasets. 
- Foster interdisciplinary collaboration between spoofing generation (TTS) and detection (SASV) sides, encouraging the development of more integrated, robust, and realistic systems.

## Objectives

## Call for Papers

### Submission instructions
