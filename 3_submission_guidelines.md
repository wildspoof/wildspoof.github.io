#### **1. TTS Track**

- **The Goal of the TTS track is to develop high-quality TTS systems using in-the-wild speech data.** The training data is from the TITW dataset, and the evaluation set will be TITW-KSKT and TITW-KSUT (following the instructions [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08711), we will add more detail soon).
- We will evaluate generated samples with a variety of metrics to comprehensively understand the performance, including MCD, UTMOS, DNSMOS, WER, SPK-sim, and spoofing likelihood scores
- No framework or model restriction in the TTS-Acoustic+Vocoder challenge, we will also release the baseline training scripts and the pretrained baseline model.
- Submission package details: The synthesized voice of TITW-KSKT and TITW-KSUT test set (with at least 16kHz, in zipped format).



#### **2. SASV Track**

- **The goal of the SASV track is to build robust SASV systems, utilizing source data from real-world conditions and spoofing attacks generated by TTS systems also trained on the same real-world data.** This Spoofceleb dataset will be the training set and test set for the SASV track.
